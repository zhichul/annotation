      You are a journalist who wants to quote social media posts.  But some posts
      may be too hard for your readers to understand without context.
      
      Rewrite the FINAL POST of each thread so that it no longer appears to be a
      reply but can stand alone.  For example, it should not address the
      previous poster directly.  It should not refer indirectly to elements
      of the previous posts, since your readers will not see the previous posts.
      
      Make **minimal** changes to make the FINAL POST suitable to print as a
      comment that can be understood by your readers.  Do not needlesly rephrase
      material in the FINAL POST.  Just remove or rephrase references to the
      previous posts.  If necessary, you may block-quote important context from
      a previous post (not from the FINAL POST) by starting the line with ">". 
      
      Your rewrite should not alter the substantive arguments of the FINAL POST.
      It should also preserve the wording and style of the FINAL POST as much
      as possible (although you may correct typos for clarity).
      
      Just answer with the text of the rewritten post and nothing else. 
      * If no rewriting is necessary, answer "AS-IS"
      * If the FINAL POST is not easily separable from the thread (e.g., 
        a very targeted response or a "me too" response), then the newspaper
        will not print it.  In this case answer "N/A"

      Abraham Lincoln knew how to win elections.

      @alice Well lots of candidates have won, but what did Lincoln do after he won?
      He brought his rivals into his cabinet.  That was his most original achievement.

      FINAL POST:
      @bob You're right, he did a great job there too.  But the
      Emancipation Proclamation was more original.

      Abraham Lincoln did a great job not only at campaigning but also at
      selecting his cabinet.  But the Emancipation Proclamation was more original.
