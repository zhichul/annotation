      You are a political science researcher with past experience as a social
      media moderator.  For each social media thread, code its {{ post.name }} 
      as directed.
  - user: |-
      {{ post.thread }}

      Characterize the {{ post.name }} just above by filling out the following
      JSON template. A <LIST> is a JSON list that may be empty [] or contain 1
      element or multiple elements.  Each element **must be understandable on
      its own**, by someone who has **not** read the social media thread or any
      of the other elements in the <LIST> or the JSON.  Thus, be explicit when
      writing each element: 
      * do not use pronouns that assume knowledge of external context
      * do not omit important arguments to verbs
      * spell out the full names of people and entities
      * etc.

      If the post contains sarcasm, answer with respect to the poster's actual
      underlying position, not the position that they are sarcastically adopting.

      where
      * "publicness": Does the {{ post.name }} comment on matters that
        are of interest beyond this thread?  Answer 0 if it is a
        private message, or makes no substantive argument, or is only
        responding to a specific statement in the thread that is
        unlikely to be repeated elsewhere.
      
      * "links": The {{ post.name }} may refer implicitly to other articles
        earlier in the thread.  Which links should you read in order to
        **understand** the {{ post.name }}?

      * "sentiment_positive": What does the {{ post.name }} express positive
        sentiment towards, explicitly or implicitly?  Who or what 
        specifically is good and should be supported or strengthened?
        To repeat, each noun phrase that you list must have a clear
        referent that can be understood without further context.
 
      * "sentiment_negative": What does the {{ post.name }} express negative
        sentiment towards, explicitly or implicitly?  Who or what specifically
        is bad and should be opposed or reduced?

      * "predictions": What does the {{ post.name }} predict, if anything? 
        What will happen?

      * "evidence_public": To support its claims, what information, if any, 
        does the {{ post.name }} provide that could be verified or falsified by an
        ordinary Internet user?

      * "evidence_personal": To support its claims, what information, if any,
        does the {{ post.name }} provide from the poster's own personal
        experience?

      * "connections": Does the {{ post.name }} surprisingly connect
        disparate topics, for example in an analogy?  If so, list
        the connections.

      * "pointers": What does the {{ post.name }} recommend that its readers
        should read or experience in order to learn more?

      * "proposals": What actions, if any, does the {{ post.name }}
        recommend should be taken by society or by specific
        organizations or individuals **other than the reader**?

      * "values": What values, if any, does the {{ post.name }}
        *explicitly* articulate, perhaps to motivate its 
        "sentiments" or "proposals"?

      * "framing": How much does the {{ post.name }} try to step back from
        the debate and helpfully clarify the issues being discussed?

      * "arguments": If the post makes arguments, separately restate
        each main argument in a neutral style.  Do not disclose the
        existence of the post or the poster.  Just restate *each*
        argument directly to the reader as if it is your own argument.
        For example, do not say "Expresses support for X" or "The
        poster supports X"; say "I support X".

      * "questions": If the poster has substantive, non-rhetorical
        questions that they want others to answer, state them here
        in a neutral style.        

      * "humor": How much is the {{ post.name }} trying to be witty?

      * "engagingness": Did you enjoy reading the {{ post.name }}?  Is it
        well-written, accessible, engaging, and appropriate in length?
        Give a high score if it makes its intended point well.  Reserve
        a score of 5 for quote-worthy posts that are good enough to share.

      * "dishonesty": Does the {{ post.name }} appear to be misleading or
        intellectually dishonest?

      * "toxicity": Does the {{ post.name }} violate norms of public
        discourse, for example through *gratuitous* attacks or insults
        or violent rhetoric?
        
      * "value": Overall, and considering your previous answers, did the 
        {{ post.name }} make you think?  Was reading it a good use of your time?
