      Here is a social media thread:
      Context:
      {# ```
      {{ post0.ancestors }}
      ```#}
      [no ancestors in thread]
      FINAL POST:
      ```
      {{ post0 }}
      ```
      {# Main arguments made by the FINAL POST:
      ```
      {{ post0.arguments }}
      ``` #}
      You have just read the thread above, and are trying to decide
      what you think about the FINAL POST.  You happen to see
      the following COMMENT on another website:
      ```
      {{ post1 }}{# should eventually be post1.rewritten.  Rewritten version tries to preserve the arguments #}
      {# ```
      Main claims made by the COMMENT:
      ```
      {{ post1.claims }}
      ``` #}
      {# maybe include some other extracted qualities of post1 #}

      Please fill out the following JSON template:
      ```
