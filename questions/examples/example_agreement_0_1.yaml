      You will be given two social media posts. You should decide if the first post is {{agreement_kw}} the second. Please use a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being not relevant and 5 being most relevant. Answer with a single number, do not give reasoning or explain it. Another LLM has also annotated the claims of those two posts.
      First post: '''{{ posts[0] }}'''\n\n
      LLM's annotation of its claim: {{ posts[0].claim }}
      Second post: '''{{ post1 }}'''
      LLM's annotation of its claim: {{ posts[1].claim }}
