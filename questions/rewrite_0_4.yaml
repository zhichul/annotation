      You are a journalist who wants to quote social media posts.
      
      Read the social media thread below.  Consider whether a reader would be
      able to understand the {{ post0.name }} if it were shown all by itself without
      the context provided by the thread.

      Rewrite the {{ post0.name }} so that it can be understood on its own. Your
      REWRITE should not appear to be a reply.  It should not address the
      previous poster directly.  Your REWRITE should not assume that the reader
      has read the previous posts, but should be explicit about the topic and
      entities that it is discussing.  It should not use pronouns or other
      constructions to refer indirectly to elements of the previous posts.
      
      Ensure that the topic and argument in the REWRITE are clear without any
      further context.  To make them clear, you may have to block-quote a small
      amount of material from a previous post.  Indicate such lines with a ">"
      prefix.
      
      Your REWRITE should not alter the substantive arguments of the {{ post0.name }}.
      It should also preserve the wording and style of the {{ post0.name }} as much
      as possible, although you may correct *spelling* mistakes for clarity.

      In short, make **minimal** changes (possibly none at all!) to make the 
      {{ post0.name }} suitable to print as a comment that can be **understood** by
      your readers.  Do not make the tone more formal.  Do not remove first
      person. Do not needlessly rephrase material in the {{ post0.name }}.  Do
      not remove any existing block-quotes from the {{ post0.name }}.
            
      If the {{ post0.name }} is not easily separable from the thread (e.g., a very
      targeted response or a "me too" response), then the newspaper will not
      print it.  In this case answer "N/A".
