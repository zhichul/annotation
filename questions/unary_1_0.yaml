      You are a political science researcher with past experience as a social media moderator.  For each social media thread, code its {{post.name}} as directed.
  - user: |-
      {{post.thread}}

      Characterize the {{post.name}} just above by filling out the following JSON template. A <LIST> may be empty [] or contain 1 element or multiple elements.  Each element **must be understandable on its own**, by someone who has **not** read the social media thread or any of the other elements in the <LIST> or the full JSON.  Thus, be explicit when writing each element: 

      * do not use pronouns that assume knowledge of external context
      * do not omit important arguments to verbs
      * spell out the full names of people and entities
      * etc.

      If the post contains sarcasm/humor, answer with respect to the poster's actual underlying position, not the position that they are sarcastically/humorously adopting.

      where

      * "publicness": Does the {{post.name}} comment on matters that are of interest beyond this thread?  Answer 0 if it is a private message, or makes no substantive argument, or is only responding to a specific statement in the thread that is unlikely to be repeated elsewhere.
      
      * "links": The {{post.name}} may refer implicitly to other articles earlier in the thread.  Which links should you read in order to **understand** the {{post.name}}?

      * "sentiment_positive": What does the {{post.name}} express positive sentiment towards, explicitly or implicitly?  Who or what specifically is good and should be supported or strengthened? To repeat, each noun phrase that you list must have a clear referent that can be understood without further context.
 
      * "sentiment_negative": What does the {{post.name}} express negative sentiment towards, explicitly or implicitly?  Who or what specifically is bad and should be opposed or reduced?

      * "predictions": What does the {{post.name}} predict, if anything? What will happen?

      * "predictions_rating": 0 if there are no predictions, 1 if there are incidental predictions, 2 if the predictions are a main point of the post, 3 if they are specific, 4 if they are creative or insightful.

      * "evidence_public": To support its claims, what information, if any, does the {{post.name}} provide that could be verified or falsified by an ordinary Internet user?

      * "evidence_public_rating": Analogous to "predictions_rating". Again, use 3 if the evidence is specific. Use the top score of 4 if the evidence is very apropos or may be unfamiliar to other social media users.

      * "evidence_personal": To support its claims, what information, if any, does the {{post.name}} provide from the poster's own personal experience?

      * "evidence_personal_rating": Analogous to "predictions_rating". Use the top score of 4 if the personal experiences are engaging or relevant.

      * "connections": Does the {{post.name}} surprisingly connect disparate topics, for example in an analogy or comparison?  If so, list the connections.

      * "connections_rating": Analogous to "predictions_rating". Use the top score of 4 if the connections are useful, creative, or may be unfamiliar to other social media users.

      * "pointers": What does the {{post.name}} recommend that its readers should read or experience in order to learn more?  Cite these things so that they are easy to find.

      * "proposals": What actions, if any, does the {{post.name}} recommend should be taken by society or by specific organizations or individuals **other than the reader**?

      * "proposals_rating": Analogous to "predictions_rating". Use the top score of 4 if the proposals are thought-provoking.

      * "values": What values, if any, does the {{post.name}} *explicitly* articulate, perhaps to motivate its "sentiments" or "proposals"?

      * "values_rating": Analogous to "predictions_rating". Use the top score of 4 if the stated values bring the issues into focus, motivating the sentiments, proposals, or connections.

      * "framing": If the {{post.name}} tries to step back from the debate and clarify the issues being discussed by others, what issues does it identify?

      * "framing_rating": Analogous to "predictions_rating". Use the top score of 4 if the framing sheds light and will help facilitate a more constructive discussion.

      * "arguments": What are the main arguments of the {{post.name}}, if any?
        IMPORTANT: State these fully and neutrally, identifying exactly who or what you are talking about so that the arguments can be understood by an ordinary reader who hasn't read the post or the thread.
        IMPORTANT: Do not restate all the supporting evidence, values, etc.  Rather, focus on the 0 to 3 main points that the poster is trying to convince the reader of. Do not disclose the existence of the post or the poster.  Just restate *each* argument directly to the reader as if it is your own argument. For example, do not say "Expresses support for X" or "The poster supports X"; say "I support X".  

      * "questions": If the poster has substantive, non-rhetorical questions that they want others to answer, state them here in a neutral style.        

      * "humor": How much is the {{post.name}} trying to be witty?  0 if it it is not trying, 1 if it is expressing a serious point in a jocular tone, 2 if it is primarily just joking.  Use the top score of 3 if it is genuinely funny, whether or not the joke or another part of the post makes a serious point.

      * "engagingness": Did you enjoy reading the {{post.name}}?  Is it well-written, accessible, engaging (perhaps funny), and appropriate in length? Give a high score if it makes its intended point well.  Reserve a score of 5 for quote-worthy posts that are good enough to share.

      * "dishonesty": Does the {{post.name}} appear to be misleading or intellectually dishonest?

      * "toxicity": Does the {{post.name}} violate norms of public discourse, for example through *gratuitous* attacks or insults or violent rhetoric?
        
      * "value": Overall, and considering your previous answers, did the {{post.name}} make you think?  Was reading it a good use of your time?
