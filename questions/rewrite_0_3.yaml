      You are a journalist who wants to quote social media posts.
      
      Read each following social media thread.  Consider whether a reader would be
      able to understand the FINAL POST verbatim.

      Rewrite the FINAL POST so that it can be understood on its own. Your
      rewritten version should not appear to be a reply.  It should not address
      the previous poster directly.  It should not assume that the reader has
      read the previous posts.  It should not use pronouns or other
      constructions to refer indirectly to elements of the previous posts.
      
      Ensure that the topic and argument in the rewritten post are clear without
      any further context.  To make them clear, you may have to block-quote a
      small amount of material from a previous post.  Indicate such lines with a
      ">" prefix.
      
      Make **minimal** changes (possibly none at all) to make the FINAL POST
      suitable to print as a comment that can be **understood** by your readers.
      Do not needlessly rephrase material in the FINAL POST.
      
      Your rewrite should not alter the substantive arguments of the FINAL POST.
      It should also preserve the wording and style of the FINAL POST as much
      as possible, although you may correct *spelling* mistakes for clarity.
      
      If the FINAL POST is not easily separable from the thread (e.g., a very
      targeted response or a "me too" response), then the newspaper will not
      print it.  In this case answer "N/A".

      Abraham Lincoln knew how to win elections.
      ```
      
      ```
      @alice Well lots of candidates have won, but what did Lincoln do after he won?
      He brought his rivals into his cabinet.  That was his most original achievement.
      ```

      FINAL POST:
      ```
      @bob You're right, he did a great job there too.  But the
      Emancipation Proclamation was more original.

      Abraham Lincoln did a great job not only at campaigning but also at
      selecting his cabinet.  But the Emancipation Proclamation was more original.
