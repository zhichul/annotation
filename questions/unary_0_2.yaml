      You are a political science researcher with past experience as a social

      FINAL POST:
      ```
      {{ post0 }}
      ```
      Evaluate the FINAL POST by filling out the following JSON template.  
      A <LIST> is a JSON list that may be empty [] or contain 1 element or
      multiple elements.
      ```
      {
        "publicness": <NUMBER FROM 0 to 2>,
        # include the remaining fields only if "publicness" > 0
        "links": <LIST OF URLS>,

        "sentiment_negative": <LIST OF PHRASES>,

      where
      * "publicness": Does the FINAL POST comment on matters that
        are of interest beyond this thread?  Answer 0 if it is a
        private message, or makes no substantive argument, or is only
        responding to a specific statement in the thread that is
        unlikely to be repeated elsewhere.
      
      * "links": The FINAL POST may refer implicitly to other articles
        earlier in the thread.  Which links should you read in order to
        **understand** the FINAL POST?

      * "sentiment_positive": What does the FINAL POST express positive
        sentiment towards?
 
      * "sentiment_negative": What does the FINAL POST express negative
        sentiment towards?

      * "predictions": What does the FINAL POST predict, if anything?

      * "evidence_public": What information, if any, does the FINAL POST
        provide that could be verified or falsified by an ordinary
        Internet user?

      * "evidence_personal": What information, if any, does the FINAL
        POST provide from the poster's own personal experience?

      * "connections": Does the FINAL POST surprisingly connect
        disparate topics, for example in an analogy?  If so, list
        the connections.

      * "pointers": What does the FINAL POST recommend that its readers
        should read or experience in order to learn more?

      * "proposals": What actions, if any, does the FINAL POST
        recommend should be taken by society or by specific
        organizations or individuals **other than the reader**?

      * "values": What values, if any, does the FINAL POST
        *explicitly* articulate, perhaps to motivate its 
        "sentiments" or "proposals"?

      * "framing": How much does the FINAL POST try to step back from
        the debate and helpfully clarify the issues being discussed?

      * "arguments": If the post makes arguments, separately restate
        each main argument in a neutral style.  Do not disclose the
        existence of the post or the poster.  Just restate *each*
        argument directly to the reader as if it is your own argument.
        For example, do not say "Expresses support for X" or "The
        poster supports X"; say "I support X".

      * "humor": How much is the FINAL POST trying to be witty?

      * "engagingness": Did you enjoy reading the FINAL POST?  Is it
        well-written, accessible, engaging, and appropriate in length?
        Give a high score if it makes its intended point well.  Reserve
        a score of 5 for quote-worthy posts that are good enough to share.

      * "dishonesty": Does the FINAL POST appear to be misleading or
        intellectually dishonest?

      * "offensiveness": Does the FINAL POST violate norms of public
        discourse, for example through *gratuitous* attacks or insults
        or violent rhetoric?
        
      * "value": Overall, and considering your previous answers, did the 
        FINAL POST make you think?  Was reading it a good use of your time?
