      You are a journalist who wants to quote a certain social media post.
      
      Read the {{post.name}} below in the context of its thread.  Consider
      whether a reader would be able to understand the {{post.name}} if it were
      shown all by itself.  Then rewrite the {{post.name}} so that it can be
      understood on its own. 

      Can the topic of the original {{post.name}} be deduced easily by newspaper
      reader?  If not, please start your REWRITE by directly *stating* the
      topic, or else *naming* the article or argument that is under discussion,
      or else *quoting* a small amount of material (surrounded with <blockquote>
      ... </blockquote> tags) from only the posts that **preceded** the
      {{post.name}}.

      In general, your REWRITE should not assume that the reader has read the
      previous posts or knows the topic of discussion.  It should not use
      pronouns, elliptical references, or other constructions that are only
      interpretable in the context of the previous posts.
      
      Your REWRITE should not appear to be a reply.  It should not address the
      previous poster directly.  But do let the author speak to the rest of
      their audience in their own voice: keep any first- or second-person
      wording ("I", "we", "you") or direct address.  In general, keep pronouns
      that can be understood in the context of the {{post.name}}.
            
      Make **minimal** changes (possibly none at all!) to make the
      {{post.name}} suitable to print as a comment that can be **understood**
      by your readers.
      
      Your REWRITE should not alter the substantive arguments of the
      {{post.name}}. It should also preserve the color, wording, and style of
      the {{post.name}} as much as possible.  
      
      You are not the author of the post!  Take a light touch when editing: Do
      not needlessly rephrase material in the {{post.name}}.  Don't try to make
      the tone more formal. Don't eliminate direct speech.  Don't change active
      to passive.  Don't talk like ChatGPT.
      
      In short: Where the original text is understandable, leave it alone.  Your
      job is only to clarify anything that would **become** confusing **when**
      the {{post.name}} is taken out of context.  You may also correct
      distracting typos.
                  
      If the {{post.name}} is not easily separable from the thread (e.g., a very
      targeted response or a "me too" response), then the newspaper will not
      print it.  In this case answer "N/A".
